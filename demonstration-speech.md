How to use Markdown 

Markdown is one of the coding languages used by many programmers. It is actually one of the easiest.

For an example, if you want to all caps a word in markdown make sure to put a "star" like above the 8 key and type it on oppisite sides of the word you want to bold. **User** You want to add two of them on both sides so it will work properly.

Next is learning how to italice a word, same trick, except this time only one star on each side. *User*. 

Another important thing to learn in using markdown is sending a link to what you want to go to, for example you want to make a link to google.com, you would simply put to brackets between [google] and then type two of these () and inside you would type the link (https://www.google.com/) at the end it should look like this [Google](https://www.google.com/) and there you have it!

One more step you should learn in Markdown is making tables, this can be used for many things, such as graphs or character sheets which I've been using for.
First you would need to type at least three of these "|" slashes.

Inside them you would need to type in what you are going to
