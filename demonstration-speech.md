How to use Markdown 

Markdown is one of the coding languages used by many programmers. It is actually one of the easiest.

For an example, if you want to all caps a word in markdown make sure to put a "star" like above the 8 key and type it on oppisite sides of the word you want to bold. **User** You want to add two of them on both sides so it will work properly.

Next is learning how to italice a word, same trick, except this time only one star on each side. *User*. 

Another important thing to learn in using markdown is sending a link to what you want to go to, for example you want to make a link to google.com, you would simply put to brackets between [google] and then type two of these () and inside you would type the link (https://www.google.com/) at the end it should look like this [Google](https://www.google.com/) and there you have it!

One more step you should learn in Markdown is making tables, this can be used for many things, such as graphs or character sheets which I've been using for.
First you would need to type at least three of these "|" slashes. 

like this |||

Inside them you would need to type in what you are going to list for example:

|Category 1|Category 2|

Then at the bottom you would have to type three more slashes just like the ones above, except this time you will need to put three of these "-" inside both of them like this:

|Category 1|Category 2|
|---|---|

Finally you will be ready to create the boxes, by simply typing in three more slashes and typing the items you wish to put in between them.

|category 1|category 2|
|---|---|
|Item 1|item 2|

And there you have your very own table created by Markdown using Github!
